# Network detection

There is a shark in your wire.

Introduction:
In order to prevent or stop attacks on a network, you must be able to analyse your network. There are many tools available to do this, but this exercise will focus on two very popular ones: 

NMAP;  

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a tool that scans a network to find information about it. For example, what ports are open in a host in your network.





Wireshark;

is a protocol analyzer. It looks at network traffic and shows information about packets like protocol and destination (among other things).

Requirements:
Your Linux machine
Wireshark
Study:
Scan the network of your Linux machine using nmap. What do you find?
Open Wireshark in Windows/MacOS Machine. Analyse what happens when you open an internet browser. (Tip: you will find that Zoom is constantly sending packets over the network. You can either turn off Zoom for a minute, or look for the packets sent by the browser between the packets sent by Zoom.)
