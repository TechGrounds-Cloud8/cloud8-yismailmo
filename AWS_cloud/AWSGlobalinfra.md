AWS Global Infrastructure

Introduction:
In the cloud, everything from servers to networking is virtualized. As an AWS customer, you donâ€™t have to worry about the underlying physical infrastructure. That being said, the physical location of an application in the cloud can be important.

AWS has a global infrastructure made up of the following components:
Regions
Availability Zones
Edge Locations

As a customer, you have different amounts of control over where your stuff is located depending on the service you use.
For example, IAM is a global service, so you get no control over where its information is stored. In contrast, you can select specific Availability Zones for RDS instances.

What is an AWS Availability Zone?
Is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity housed in separate facility.

What is a Region?
What is an Edge Location?
Why would you choose one region over another? (e.g. eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) over us-west-2 (Oregon)).
