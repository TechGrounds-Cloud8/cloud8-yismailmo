Daemons  runs in the background and is not interactive.

Services may be interactive and  is run & used by users (vim).
Service also responds to requests from programs.

SSH helps with connecting to a linux machine so to start SSH services youÄºl need to start ssh daemon. So before ssh came there was telnet (did the same thing as ssh but not encrypted)

A process is an instance of running code. All code is stored in files somewhere on the system. In order to find these files, Linux will look in the $PATH variable (more about that in a later exercise). Every process has its own PID (Process ID) number.
