# Azure Functions

Azure Function is a service that allows you to run activated code without having to provision or manage infrastructure (like Lambda in AWS). You can easily designate an SQL and the type of trigger you want to run, which then syncs seamlessly with a text editor like VSCODE.
You can use Azure Functions for:

 - Reminders and notifications.
 - Scheduled tasks and messages.
 - File handling.
 - Data or data stream processing.
 - Run backup tasks in the background.
 - Making backend calculations.
 - Lightweight web APIs (MVPs).
