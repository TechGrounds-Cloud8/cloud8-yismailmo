# Azure Core Services

This contains the services that you need to know in a little more detail. This document also describes how to deal with the other services that you may encounter in the (practice) exam.

There are many services in Azure, but some are more important than others. 

Azure lists the following architectural components and services that you should know in-depth about what they do:


- Regions and Region Pairs
- Availability Zones
- Resource Groups
- Subscriptions
- mManagement Groups
- Azure Resource Manager
- Virtual Machines
- Azure App Services
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Virtual Desktop
- Virtual Networks

- ExpressRoute
- Container (Blob) Storage
- Disk Storage
- File Storage
- Storage Tiers
- Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- SQL Managed Instance
- Azure Marketplace

Of course, there are many more services that may come up on the exam. For these services it is enough to be familiar with the product page (see an example of an Azure product page here)



In addition to the services, you can also expect questions about various cloud concepts, such as High Availability, the consumption-based pricing model and the shared responsibility model.
