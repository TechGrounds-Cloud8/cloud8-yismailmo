# Well-Architected Framework


The Cloud Providers benefit from their customers running good, secure applications on the provider's infrastructure. The Well-Architected Framework was created to give customers a guideline on what a good, secure application looks like.

The Well-Architected Framework of Azure and AWS are very similar(eventhough AWS has now added sustainability). They are based on almost the same 'pillars', namely:

- Cost Optimization
- Reliability
- Operational Excellence
- Performance Efficiency
- Security


In short **CROPS**.

Each pillar discusses an aspect of your application, and how the Cloud can help to optimize it.

As a cloud engineer, I'm expected to be able to build an application with this Well-Architected Framework that makes optimal use of the possibilities in the Cloud.

How to implement each pillar with cloud services

 Cost Optimization are five design principles in the cloud:

    - Implement cloud financial management
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated running heavy workloads.
    - Analyzing and allocating expenses.



There are five design principles in the cloud in Reliability:

    - Automatically recover from an error
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Horizontally scale to increase total workload availability
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation
  


Operational Excellence, five design principles in the cloud are:

    - Make edits as code
    - Make small, reversible changes regularly
    - Refine surgery procedures regularly
    - Anticipate failure
    - Learn from all operational mistakes


Performance Efficiency, there are five design principles in the cloud:

    - Democratizing advanced technologies
    - Go worldwide in minutes
    - Using serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Consider mechanical sympathy



In Security are seven design principles in the cloud:

    - Implement a strong identity foundation
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply security to all layers
    - Automate security best practices
    - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Keep people away from data
    - Prepare for security events
