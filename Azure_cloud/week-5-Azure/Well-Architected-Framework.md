# Well-Architected Framework


The Cloud Providers benefit from their customers running good, secure applications on the provider's infrastructure. The Well-Architected Framework was created to give customers a guideline on what a good, secure application looks like.

The Well-Architected Framework of Azure and AWS are very similar. They are based on almost the same 'pillars', namely:

- reliability
- Security
- Cost Optimization
- Operational Excellence
- Performance Efficiency


A way to remember these pillars is CROPS.

Each pillar discusses an aspect of your application, and how the Cloud can help to optimize it.

You, as a cloud engineer, should be able to build an application with this Well-Architected Framework that makes optimal use of the possibilities in the Cloud.
