# Azure Storage Account

To store data in Azure you need an Azure Storage Account. A Storage Account contains all Azure Storage data objects such as blobs, files, disks and tables.

Data in a Storage Account is secure, highly available, durable and massively scalable. All data in a Storage Account is accessible via the internet with HTTP and HTTPS. Because it is easy to access, you have to be careful that only the correct identities have permissions to access the data.

Azure Storage explorer is a free GUI to manage your data in Azure.

Many IaaS and PaaS services from Azure also use Azure Storage Accounts.
Necessities:
Your Azure Cloud environment (link)
Azure Storage Explorer
Assignment:
Create an Azure Storage Account. Make sure that only you have access to the data.
Place data in a storage service of your choice via the console (for example a cat photo in Blob storage).
Retrieve the data to your own computer using the Azure Storage Explorer.
