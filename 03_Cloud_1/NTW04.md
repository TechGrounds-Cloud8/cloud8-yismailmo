Counting in Binary and Hex
Introduction:
You have probably already heard that a computer counts using zeros and ones. This is not technically true. 
A computer can only detect whether or not there is an electrical signal present. A signal is represented as a 1, 
the absence of electricity is represented as a 0. Because thereâ€™s only two options (0 and 1), this way of representing numbers is called binary.
One physical unit that can contain (or not contain) electricity is called a bit. One bit is represented by one digit in a binary number. 


Study:
Counting in base 2 and base 16
Exercise :
Translate the following decimal numbers into binary:

Decimal
Binary
16  

0001 0000


128 

1000 0000


228 

1110 0100


112  

0111 0000


73  

0100 1001




Translate the following binary numbers into decimal:
Binary
Decimal
1010 1010

128 + 32 + 8 + 2 = 170

1111 0000

128+64+32+16 = 240


1101 1011

128+64+16+8+2+1 = 219

1010 0000

128+32 = 160

0011 1010

32+16+8+2 = 58
