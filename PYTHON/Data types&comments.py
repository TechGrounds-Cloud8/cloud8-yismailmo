# Exercise 1
a = 'int'
b = 7
c = False
d = "18.5"

# since b is an integer, and d is valued as a sting. 
# so I have to change it to a float in order to add b and d
x = ((b) +float(d))
print (x)

# Exercise 2

username = input("Enter username")
print("Username is: " + username)

user_input = input()
print(user_input)
