# Asymmetric encryption

### Introduction

The previous assignment introduced you to cryptography and symmetric encryption. In the previous exercise, you shared your encryption key with the recipient of your message. This means that anyone who has the key can decrypt the message.

Asymmetric encryption solves this issue. Instead of 1 key, you get 2: A public key, and a private key.

Requirements
The Slack channel your share with your group
A peer
A key pair generator like https://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/

### Exercise

#### Generate a key pair.


Send an asymmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. The recipient should be able to read the message, but it should remain a secret to everyone else.
You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides Slack. Analyse the difference between this method and symmetric encryption.
