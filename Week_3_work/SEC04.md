# Symmetric encryption

Introduction
Encryption:

Decipher:


is an important tool for securing data. Be it data at rest, or data in motion. A lot of what you do on your computer and the Internet is encrypted.

Throughout history humanity has come up with many ciphers to encode information. Most of these are symmetric ciphers, the most famous one being the Caesar cipher.

In this assignment you will learn about the basics of 

cryptography; 

It refers to the method used to protect sensitive information. 

So this means that it's mainly used to encrypt and decrypt data or messages that cannot be deciphered by unauthorized access. 

It deploys the use of scrambled or distorted symbols. It is simply used to provide extra security to ensure that only authorized users can understand the message. 

 

starting with symmetrical encryption.

Requirements
The Slack channel your share with your group
A peer

Exercise
Find two more historic ciphers besides the Caesar cipher.
Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.


Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. 


You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides Slack. Analyse the shortcomings of this method.
